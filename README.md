# Poke-Packer
* Welcome to Poke-Packer, this website is a simulation of the hit game Pokemon TCG Pocket. The website can be found here https://poke-packer.onrender.com/
* Note that the webapp takes a long time to load up as it is hosted on a free website hoster called render.
* This app was created while I was following the full stack open course meant to demonstrate my skills in full stack development(react node express and mongodb).
* If you enjoyed the simulator please star my project!
## Purpose
* I created this app to challenge myself to learn new programming skills.
* I am proud of how it turned out and hope to build on the functionality soon.
